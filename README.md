# Brain-Tumor-Detection
 
Overview:

This project involves developing a deep learning model to detect the presence of brain tumors from MRI images. The model uses advanced image processing techniques and a binary classification approach to distinguish between MRI images with and without tumors.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project consists of MRI images categorized into two classes: with tumor and without tumor. The images were preprocessed to enhance the accuracy of the model.

Model Architecture:
The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the spatial features of the MRI images. The architecture includes several convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers to perform binary classification.
